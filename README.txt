A simple, test project that will get me back on track to working on a Windows machine.
This will be an Odds Calculator, telling you what the likelyhood is of rolling a series of numbers on dice of your choosing.

COMPLETION CRITERIA
The app can take in a list of dice of any sides, and run constant rolls on them.
You can request a specific pattern of dice rolls, such as odds of 1-2 on a 6 sided dice three times.
The app will run it for 100 times, then display the percentage (and fraction) of how many times it came up.
